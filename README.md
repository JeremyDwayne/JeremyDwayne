# Hi there, I'm Jeremy ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been solving puzzles as a software engineer for over 6 years. I specialize in backend development using ruby, php, and javascript, but will use whatever is best to solve the problem. I currently have an interest in growing my understanding of machine learning, devops, and site reliability. 

In my free time I enjoy road cycling ðŸš´, reading ðŸ“–, and recently started working towards my private pilot's license âœˆ
