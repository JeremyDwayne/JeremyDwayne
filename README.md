# Hi there, I'm Jeremy 👋

I've been building resilient software for over 8 years. My expertise is in optimizing and scaling the backend services of distributed systems. As a technical leader I am passionate about mentoring, establishing best practices within teams, and improving workflows. 

🔭 I've primarilly worked with Ruby throughout my career, but I am actively working on a side project, [saferpilot](https://www.github.com/jeremydwayne/safer-pilot), in Go and Next.js.

✈️ When I'm not behind a desk you'll likely find me up in the sky flying my 1963 Piper Cherokee 180.

I am actively looking for my next IC role and would love to connect with you to discuss opportunities you're recruiting for.
