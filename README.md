## About Me 👨‍💻

🛠 Code-slinger. ✈️ Cockpit strategist.  
I build high-performance systems — for the cloud and the runway.

I’m a seasoned software engineer with a knack for turning complex problems into clean, scalable solutions. Whether I’m architecting a full-stack app, managing infrastructure upgrades, or designing flight training tools that actually make pilots safer, I’m all about precision, performance, and pushing things forward.

Currently building Safer Pilot, a platform that helps aviation businesses transform pilot proficiency through smart repetition, instructor insights, and aviation-specific UX.

Always iterating. Never just shipping it and forgetting it.
